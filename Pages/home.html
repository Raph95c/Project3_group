<h1 style="font-size:35px;"></h1style>Welcome to Group 1 Project </h1>
<br>
<h2>About:</h2>


<p>In this project, we try to delve into earthquake data to find any patterns in the intensity, frequency or characteristics in earthquakes in and around California. 
  We used data for earthquakes that are greater than 3.0  in magnitude since it provides a large enough pool of earthquake points and the size can be sensed.
</p>

<h2>Research Questions</h2>
<p>
  Has there been an increase in the number of earthquakes in the last 20 years?
  <br>Have earthquakes intensified in the last 20 years?
  <br>Is there a correlation between magnitude and depth of an earthquake?
  <br>Which is the most active fault line in California looking at San Andreas, Hayward, and Calaveras Fault lines only?

<h2>How are earthquakes measured?</h2>
<p>Earthquakes are measured by magnitude using a seismograph. With the data from the seismograph the magnitude can be calculate using one of eight ways.
  Magnitude is logrithmic, meaning that a difference of one magnitude means the larger earthquake is 10 times more powerful than the smaller earthquake.
