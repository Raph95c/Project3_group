<h1 style="font-size:35px;"></h1style>Final Analysis</h1>
<br>
<p>In this project, we determine if there has been a change in the frequency and severity of earthquakes in California over the last 20 years. We will examine the magnitude and location of earthquakes to also determine which fault line is most active in California. Our timeline for investigation is 01/01/2000 – 01/01/2023 for earthquakes having a minimum magnitude of 3.0.</p>
<h6 id="q1">Have earthquakes intensified in magnitude over the last 20 years?</h6>
<p>The average magnitude of earthquakes greater than 3.0 recorded per year was determined and visualized using bar chart </p>

<br>
<p>The average magnitude of earthquakes recorded from 2000 through 2022 was between 3.0 and 3.5 indicating that earthquakes have not intensified over the last 20 years.</p>

<h6 id="q2">Has there been an increase in the number of earthquakes in the last 20 years?</h6>
<p>The graph above shows the Total Number of Earthquakes per year greater than 3.0  
  In the years 2010 and 2019 there is an increase in earthquakes followed by years of  decrease
  Indicating there is no consistent overall increase in the number of earthquakes 
  </p>

<h6 id="q3">Is there a coorelation between the depth of an earthquake compared to the magnitude of the earthquake?</h6>
<p>As we saw there wasn't in increase of high magnitudes earthquakes. We wanted to see if there were similiar chararcteristics between earthquakes.
  Beside the location, there was data on the depth in kilometers and the magnitude. Would there be a defining coorelation when compaing the depth of an earthquake that can signal the magnitude of it? </p>

<p>Using a scatter plot, we divided the data for the depth and magnitude into a time intervals of five years from 2000 to 2022(the last chart will only have 20-22).
  It was split into five to get a clear picture without bunching thousands of datapoint into one chart. </p>

<p>There is a clear pattern that shows in all the charts. There is a right-skewed bell curve. A majority of the datapoint appear before the median and the max magnitude.
  Max magnitudes fell between the range of 5 to 15 kilometers. There are exceptions to larger than normal magnitudes in 2008 and 2012. </p>
