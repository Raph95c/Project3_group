        <h6>Have earthquakes intensified in magnitude over the last 20 years?</h6>
        <p>The average magnitude of earthquakes greater than 3.0 recorded per year was determined and visualized using bar chart <br>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raph95c/Project3_group/main/Visuals/AvgMagByYear.png">
                       <br>
           The average magnitude of earthquakes recorded from 2000 through 2022 was between 3.0 and 3.5 indicating that earthquakes have not intensified over the last 20 years.
        </p>
        <h6>Has there been an increase in the number of earthquakes in the last 20 years?</h6>
        <p>The total number of earthquakes recorded per year was determined and visualized using a bar chart<br>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raph95c/Project3_group/main/Kelly/Total%20Earthquakes%20by%20Year.png">
            <br>
            Although some variation is noted each year, there has been no consistent increase in the number of earthquakes recorded with a magnitude >3.0.
            2010 and 2019 are outliers with 745 and 1323 earthquakes respectively.

        <h6>Which is the most active fault line in California looking at San Andreas, Hayward and Calaveras fault lines only. </h6>
        <p>Analysis<br>
        <h6>Is there a coorelation between the magnitude of an earthquake and its depth?</h6>
        <p>Using a scatter plot, earthquakes data was seperated 5 years apart<br>
            ​<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raph95c/Project3_group/main/Visuals/mag_depth_2000.png" >
            ​<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raph95c/Project3_group/main/Visuals/mag_depth_2005.png" >
            <br>
        Although there are some slight variation in slope of +/-3 from 0, the depth of an earthquake does not determine the magnitude.
        There is a slight note of a left skewed bell curve.
