Project 3 : California Earthquakes – Is the next big one coming?
Group 1:
Team Members: Robert Hascall, Quoc Tran, Alexis Valdez, Kelly Stave, Raymundo Zapien
Overview:
The aim of our project is to determine if there has been a change in the frequency and severity of earthquakes in California over the last 20 years. We will examine the magnitude and location of earthquakes to also determine which fault line is most active in California. Our timeline for investigation is 01/01/2000 – 01/01/2023 for earthquakes having a minimum magnitude of 3.0.
Question:
1.	Have earthquakes intensified in the last 20 years?
2.	Has there been an increase in the number of earthquakes in the last 20 years?
3.	Which is the most active fault line in California looking at San Andreas, Hayward and Calaveras fault lines only?
